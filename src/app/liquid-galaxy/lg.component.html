      <p>If you do not have a Liquid Galaxy setup yet, getting one ready just takes a few minutes (<a href="https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy" target="_blank">and all its code is open-source</a>).</p>

      <p>Grab a few average machines, connect each of them to a distinct screen, and follow these instructions.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Install Ubuntu to each of each (see <a href="https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> for the current supported versions).  
        <li>Execute <code>bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy/master/install.sh)</code></li>
      </ol>

      <p>See detailed instructions <a href="https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="install-api">Install Liquid Galaxy API on the master machine</h2>

      <p>
        Memories does its cast <i>magic</i> by making use of a public API placed on the Liquid Galaxy master machine.
        Installing it is as simple as running the following script:
      </p>

      <code>bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy-api/master/scripts/install.sh)</code>

      <p>See detailed instructions <a href="https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy-api/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="cast">Cast</h2>

      <p>When your Liquid Galaxy is displaying Google Earth across its screens, and the API is up and ready (you can verify so by entering  <code>&lt;ip-address&gt;:82</code> on your browser), you are ready to cast.</p>

      <p>Press the <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> icon at the top, select your Liquid Galaxy setup<sup>1</sup>, and journeys and stories will start showing<sup>2</sup> on the screens as you enter them on your device.</p>

      <div class="image-block">
        <img src="/assets/cast-to.png" />
      </div>

      <p>Liquid Galaxy users will only have to go through this step.</p>

      <span class="hint"><sup>1</sup> By default, Liquid Galaxy setups can only be discovered by those who are in the same network (so you might have to connect through Wi-Fi on your mobile devices).</span>
      <span class="hint"><sup>2</sup> Only geolocalized stories will be shown.</span>
